# What's Drive?
Drive is a straigh copy from [@adonisjs/drive](https://github.com/adonisjs/drive). And Adonijs Drive is at the same time super similar to Rails ActiveStorage.

In a nutshell what this package does is to abstract how files are stored in the application. In development Drive provides a Disk abstraction and files are stored locally. On the other hand in production you can use an S3 drive adapter and upload files to an S3 bucket.
