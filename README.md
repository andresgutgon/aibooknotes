## What's this?
This project is a AI book notes generator for Amazon Kindle online.
In Kindle you can hightlight parts of a book and they will appear as notes in
your Kindle app or in kindle online. This project adds a small interface in the
kindle website that allows you to copie all your notes and calling OpenAI
generates a resume (TO_BE_DEFINED explanation).


### Kindle online websites
Amazon has different domains for Kindle in each country. Here is a non
exhaustive list of supported domains for this Chrome Extension:

1. Main (USA): https://read.amazon.com
2. UK: https://read.amazon.co.uk
3. Spain: https://leer.amazon.es
4. France: https://lire.amazon.fr
5. Germany: https://lesen.amazon.de
6. Canada: https://read.amazon.ca

### blank.org
This weird domain is nice to develop in isolation the extension. It could be
removed.
